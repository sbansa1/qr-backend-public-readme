## 👤 My Role

I acted as:

- **Technical Project Manager** - Owned delivery, scope, and roadmap decisions
- **Product Strategist** - Defined market positioning, pricing tiers, and go-to-market
- **Architecture Decision Owner** - Designed 19-service microservices architecture
- **Delivery and Roadmap Lead** - Managed phased rollout from MVP to enterprise scale

**Important Context:**  
AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT-4) accelerated development, but **architecture, scope, and delivery decisions were mine**. I managed the "what" and "why" while AI assisted with the "how."

> *"I'm a Project Manager, not a software engineer. So how do you build a 19-microservice platform? You treat AI as your virtual engineering squad, manage the architecture, and ship what matters."*
