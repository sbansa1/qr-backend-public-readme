## 📖 The Story

**Hey there, I'm Saurabh.** I'm a Technical Project Manager who excels at bridging the gap between high-level architectural vision and lean, efficient delivery.

This project started simply: My mom runs a small shop in India, and existing online tools just aren't "accessible" for folks like her. As a TPM who's managed multiple projects (at Venuiti Health), I thought, *"I can fix this."*

In August 2025, I began a deep dive into building an enterprise-grade solution—a **19-microservice platform** competing with Linktree, Bitly, and QR Code Generator. Here's what I learned about product strategy, cost management, and shipping MVPs in 2026.

## Overview & Motivation

### The Problem: The "A/A Gap" (Availability vs Accessibility)

While tools like **Shopify, Linktree, and Bitly** exist, I noticed a critical gap through my mom's experience running a small shop in India:

- **Availability ✅** - Tools exist everywhere
- **Accessibility ❌** - UX designed for tech-savvy users, not everyday shop owners

**Market insight:** Existing platforms focus on feature richness (enterprise users) but sacrifice simplicity (SMB users). There's a massive market for "Shopify-level features with Notion-level simplicity."

### The Solution: Enterprise Architecture with Lean Execution

I decided to design a **19-microservice SaaS platform** with a twist:
- **Design for enterprise scale** (custom domains, AI features, multi-tenancy)
- **Deploy lean MVP** (4 core services, <$50/month infrastructure)
- **Use AI as development accelerator** (I'm a PM, not a developer)

This became a case study in **balancing technical ambition with operational reality**.

## Product Thinking & Competitive Analysis

### Competitor Research (5 Platforms Analyzed)

| Platform | Strength | Weakness | My Differentiator |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Linktree** | Simple link-in-bio | Limited customization, no QR codes | QR + Microsite in one platform |
| **Bitly** | URL shortening + analytics | No landing pages | Smart routing + microsites |
| **QR Tiger** | Advanced QR codes | No microsite builder | Integrated experience |
| **Shopify** | Full e-commerce | Overwhelming for small shops | Simplified UX for non-tech users |
| **Canva** | Design tools | No QR analytics | Data-driven design |

### The "Accessibility Gap" Discovery

**User research insight (from mom's shop):**
- **Pain Point 1:** Existing tools require technical knowledge to set up domains
- **Pain Point 2:** No clear analytics for offline-to-online tracking (QR scans in store)
- **Pain Point 3:** Design tools (Canva) don't connect to business logic (Shopify)

**Product strategy decision:**
- One platform for QR codes + microsites + analytics
- Drag-and-drop editor (no coding required)
- Real-time scan tracking (bridge offline and online)

### Target Market & Positioning

**Primary Target:** 
- **Small business owners** (retail shops, restaurants, service providers)
- **Content creators** (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok influencers)
- **Marketing agencies** (managing multiple client campaigns)

**Go-to-Market Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Free tier for creators (viral loop through QR sharing)
- **Phase 2:** Pro tier for SMBs ($19/month) - custom branding
- **Phase 3:** Enterprise tier (custom pricing) - multi-tenant, white-label

## � The Lessons: From "Build It All" to "Ship What Matters"

This project was my hands-on masterclass in **FinOps, user-centric design, and realistic delivery.**

### Lesson 1: Market Analysis & the "A/A Gap"

**Discovery:** I did a competitor analysis of Shopify, Linktree, Bitly, QR Tiger, and Canva. The gap isn't a lack of tools (**Availability**), it's a lack of UX designed for non-technical users (**Accessibility**).

**Product decision:** This became my core differentiator—"Shopify-level features with Notion-level simplicity."

### Lesson 2: FinOps 101 (The AWS Wake-Up Call)

**Reality check:** It turns out running a full Kafka architecture on AWS is expensive!

**Cost breakdown (initial architecture):**
- Kafka cluster: $200+/month
- PostgreSQL (12 databases): $150+/month  
- Redis cluster: $50+/month
- CDN + monitoring: $100+/month
- **Total: $500+/month** 😱

**Decision:** Design for enterprise scale, deploy lean MVP ($50/month).

**Key learning:** *Balancing technical ambition with affordable operational reality is the ultimate PM skill.*

### Lesson 3: Agile Mindset (The Pivot)

**Original plan:** Deploy all 18 services simultaneously (Big Bang release)

**Reality:** Deployed 4 core services in Phase 1, deferred 14 services to Phase 2/3

**Agile pivot:**
- Auth, QR, Analytics, Microsite (core value delivered)
- ML, Email, Integrations (deferred until customer revenue)
- Architecture documented for future scaling

**Key learning:** *Incremental delivery > Big Bang releases.*

### Lesson 4: AI for PMs (60% Time Reduction)

**Traditional development:** 6-8 months for 4 services

**AI-assisted development:** 3 months for 4 services + full 18-service architecture

**My AI Stack:**
- **GitHub Copilot** - Real-time code suggestions in VS Code (autocomplete for boilerplate)
- **Claude Sonnet 3.5** - Architecture reviews, PRD validation, technical documentation
- **GPT-4** - Diagram generation (Mermaid.js), API design, security analysis

**How I used AI as a TPM:**
- Architecture validation (Claude reviewing system design for scalability issues)
- Code generation (Copilot for service templates, API routes, database schemas)
- Documentation (Auto-generated OpenAPI specs, README templates)
- Security scanning (Automated OWASP compliance checks)
- Diagram iteration (Generated 15+ versions of architecture diagrams)

**Example workflow:**
1. I write PRD for "QR Service with Redis caching"
2. Claude validates architecture decisions (cache TTLs, invalidation strategy)
3. GitHub Copilot generates boilerplate service code
4. I review, test, and refine the implementation
5. GPT-4 generates Mermaid diagram showing caching flow

**Key learning:** *The TPM role in 2026 is architecture orchestration, not code implementation.*

## System Architecture Design

### Full Architecture Vision (19 Services)

The platform was **designed** as a decoupled, service-oriented architecture for horizontal scaling and fault tolerance. The full architecture supports enterprise features while maintaining a clear path from MVP to scale.

```
User → Cloudflare CDN → Nginx → Tenant Gateway → Microservices → Data Layer
```

**What This System Context Shows:**

**1. People Using The System (4 Personas)**
- **Business Owner** - Manages QR codes for physical products (retail shops, restaurants)
- **End Customer** - Scans QR codes in physical locations to access microsites
- **Content Creator** - Builds link-in-bio pages for social media (Instagram, TikTok)
- **Marketing Agency** - Manages QR campaigns for multiple clients (B2B use case)

**2. The Software System (Black Box)**
- **QR & Microsite Platform** - The entire 19-service architecture appears as ONE system
- Users interact with the business capabilities, not the technical implementation
- Focus: **What value it provides**, not **how it's built internally**

**3. External Systems (7 Integrations)**
- **OpenAI API** - AI-powered content generation (deferred to Phase 2)
- **Cloudflare CDN** - Global edge caching and DDoS protection
- **SendGrid** - Transactional email delivery (welcome, notifications)
- **Twilio** - SMS alerts for limit exceeded, important events
- **Stripe** - Payment processing and subscription management
- **Mixpanel** - Product analytics and user behavior tracking
- **Sentry** - Application error monitoring and performance tracking

**4. Relationships (Communication Protocols)**
- **Person → System**: HTTPS (web browsers, mobile apps)
- **System → External Systems**: REST API (JSON over HTTPS), CDN edge delivery
- **Interactions are simplified** - Details shown in Level 2 Container Diagram below

**How It Works (Example Flow):**

**Scenario: Business Owner Creates QR Code**
1. **Business Owner** logs into web dashboard via HTTPS
2. **QR & Microsite Platform** authenticates user and displays dashboard
3. Owner creates new QR code with custom branding
4. **System** generates QR code and stores in database
5. **System** calls **Cloudflare CDN** to cache QR image globally
6. **System** sends welcome email via **SendGrid**
7. Owner shares QR code, customers scan it in physical locations
8. **System** tracks analytics and calls **Mixpanel** for product metrics
9. If errors occur, **System** reports to **Sentry**
10. When owner upgrades, **System** processes payment via **Stripe**

**Scenario: End Customer Scans QR Code**
1. **End Customer** scans QR code with phone camera
2. **QR & Microsite Platform** receives scan request via HTTPS
3. **System** fetches microsite page from database
4. **Cloudflare CDN** serves cached assets (images, CSS) from nearest edge location
5. Customer views microsite instantly (< 100ms response time)
6. **System** asynchronously tracks analytics (device, location, time)

**Why This Matters for TPM Interviews:**

**Business Context** - Shows you understand 4 distinct user personas (not just "users")  
**Integration Strategy** - 7 external dependencies managed (vendor selection decisions)  
**Phased Approach** - OpenAI marked for Phase 2 (cost-conscious planning)  
**Stakeholder Communication** - Simple diagram for non-technical audiences (executives, investors)

**From Context to Containers:**
- This Level 1 diagram shows the **business view** (what problems we solve, for whom)
- The Level 2 Container Diagram (below) shows the **technology view** (how we built it)

**Legend:**

- **Solid arrows (→)** = Synchronous communication (HTTP/REST, SQL queries)
- **Dotted arrows (-.->)** = Asynchronous communication (Kafka events)
- **[Brackets]** = Technology/Protocol used
- **Subgraphs** = Service boundaries (containers)
- **Cylinders** = Data stores (databases, caches, storage)

**Container Types in This Architecture:**

**1. Web Applications (Node.js + Fastify)**
- **API Gateway** - Entry point, rate limiting, JWT validation (Port 3000)
- **Auth Service** - User authentication, session management (Port 3010)
- **QR Service** - QR code generation and management (Port 3011)
- **Analytics Service** - Metrics processing and reporting (Port 3012)
- **Microsite Service** - Landing page builder (Port 3013)

**2. Data Stores**
- **PostgreSQL Databases** - Relational data (Users, QR Codes, Analytics, Pages)
- **Redis Caches** - In-memory storage (Rate limits, QR metadata, Hot metrics)
- **Cloudflare R2** - Object storage (QR images, Media files)

**3. Message Infrastructure**
- **Kafka Event Bus** - Asynchronous event streaming (13 topics designed)
- **Background Jobs (Consumers)** - Event processors (Node.js workers)

**4. Edge Infrastructure**
- **Cloudflare CDN** - Global edge caching and DDoS protection
- **Nginx** - Reverse proxy and load balancer

**How It Works (Request Flow Through Containers):**

**Scenario: Creating a QR Code (Synchronous Flow)**

1. **User** sends HTTPS request → **Cloudflare CDN**
   - Request: `POST /api/qr/create` with QR code data

2. **Cloudflare CDN** → **Nginx** → **API Gateway**
   - CDN routes to origin server
   - Nginx load balances to Gateway instance

3. **API Gateway** checks **Rate Limiter (Redis)**
   - Query: `GET rate_limit:user_123` → "45/100 requests in last minute"
   - Result: Under limit, proceed

4. **API Gateway** → **Auth Service**
   - Validates JWT token
   - **Auth Service** queries **User Store (PostgreSQL)**
   - Returns user permissions: Authorized

5. **API Gateway** → **QR Service**
   - Forwards authenticated request with user context

6. **QR Service** performs operations:
   - **Checks QR Cache (Redis)** first for duplicates (5ms lookup)
   - **Cache miss** → Generates new QR code
   - **Writes to QR Store (PostgreSQL)** - Saves QR metadata (50ms)
   - **Uploads image to R2 Storage** - Stores PNG/SVG file
   - **Updates QR Cache (Redis)** - Caches for future lookups (TTL: 1 hour)

7. **QR Service** publishes event (Async - Non-blocking):
   - Event: `qr.created` → **Kafka Event Bus**
   - User receives response immediately (total: ~150ms)

8. **Background Workers** consume event (Happens in parallel):
   - **Analytics Service** increments counters in **Metrics Cache**
   - Tracks creation event in **Events Store (PostgreSQL)**
   - Sends notification via external services

**Scenario: Scanning a QR Code (Cache-First Pattern)**

1. **User** scans QR code → Request hits **Cloudflare CDN**
   - Request: `GET /qr/scan/abc123`

2. **CDN** checks edge cache:
   - **Cache HIT** → Returns QR image directly (< 20ms, no origin call)
   - **Cache MISS** → Routes to **Nginx** → **API Gateway**

3. **API Gateway** → **QR Service**
   - Request: "Get QR code metadata for abc123"

4. **QR Service** cache-first lookup:
   - **Check QR Cache (Redis)** first → **HIT** (5ms)
   - Returns metadata without database query
   - *If cache miss, would query **QR Store (PostgreSQL)** (50ms)*

5. **QR Service** → **Microsite Service**
   - Request: "Get linked microsite page data"
   - **Microsite Service** queries **Page Store (PostgreSQL)**

6. **QR Service** publishes scan event (Async):
   - Event: `qr.scanned` → **Kafka Event Bus**
   - Includes: device, location, timestamp, referrer

7. **User receives redirect** (total: ~50ms)
   - Browser loads microsite
   - **Cloudflare CDN** serves static assets (images, CSS)

8. **Background Workers** process scan event (Parallel):
   - **Analytics Service** updates **Metrics Cache (Redis)**
   - Increments: `INCR scan_count:qr_abc123`
   - Every 60 seconds, batch writes to **Events Store (PostgreSQL)**

**Why This Flow Matters:**

**Performance** - Cache-first pattern achieves 100x speedup (5ms vs 500ms)  
**Scalability** - Async events decouple processing from user response  
**Resilience** - User gets response even if analytics processing fails  
**Cost Efficiency** - Redis reduces database load by 90%

---

**Key Architecture Patterns:**

- **Service Isolation** - Each service owns its data (separate databases in production)
- **Cache-First** - Redis checked before PostgreSQL (100x performance improvement)
- **Event-Driven** - Kafka enables loose coupling between services
- **Async Processing** - Background workers decouple slow operations from user requests
- **Multi-Tenant Ready** - Database-per-tenant design for enterprise isolation (Phase 3)

**Deployment & Scaling:**

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Single VPS, shared PostgreSQL/Redis, Kafka single-node, Cloudflare free tier
- **Phase 2 (Growth)**: Multi-VPS, Kafka 3-node cluster, Redis replication, Cloudflare Pro
- **Phase 3 (Enterprise)**: Kubernetes, per-tenant databases, Kafka/Redis clusters, Cloudflare Enterprise

---

**Background Jobs (Kafka Consumers) - What They Do:**

Background jobs are Node.js workers that consume events from Kafka and process them asynchronously. This architecture decouples slow operations from user-facing requests for faster response times.

**Why Separate Jobs?**
- **Fast User Response**: QR scan returns redirect in <100ms, analytics processing happens later
- **Batch Efficiency**: Process 1000 events together instead of 1000 individual database writes
- **Scalability**: Add more consumers during high traffic without affecting web services
- **Resilience**: Failed jobs retry automatically, user requests never fail due to analytics issues

**Specific Background Jobs Running:**

1. **Scan Event Processor**
   - Consumes: `qr.scanned` events from Kafka
   - Processes: Device fingerprinting, location enrichment, user agent parsing
   - Writes: Analytics DB with full scan metadata (device type, browser, OS, country, city)
   - Frequency: Real-time (processes events as they arrive)

2. **Metrics Aggregator**
   - Consumes: `analytics.metric_updated` events
   - Processes: Calculates daily/weekly/monthly aggregates (total scans, unique visitors, top locations)
   - Writes: Pre-computed dashboard metrics to Analytics DB
   - Frequency: Every 5 minutes (batch processing)

3. **Hot Metrics Sync**
   - Consumes: Timer-based (not Kafka, runs on schedule)
   - Processes: Reads Redis counters (`INCR scan_count:qr_abc123`), batches 1000s of writes
   - Writes: Flushes to Analytics PostgreSQL for persistence
   - Frequency: Every 60 seconds
   - Why: Reduces database writes by 99% (1000 Redis writes → 1 PostgreSQL batch)

4. **A/B Test Results Processor**
   - Consumes: `experiment.conversion` events
   - Processes: Calculates conversion rates, statistical significance, winning variants
   - Writes: Experiment results to Analytics DB
   - Frequency: Real-time for conversions, aggregates every 10 minutes

5. **Notification Dispatcher**
   - Consumes: `analytics.threshold_exceeded` events (e.g., QR scan limit reached)
   - Processes: Sends email/SMS notifications to users
   - External Calls: SendGrid (email), Twilio (SMS)
   - Frequency: Real-time (immediate notifications)

**Example Flow - QR Scan with Background Processing:**

```
1. User scans QR code
   → QR Service receives request (10ms)
   → Check cache for QR metadata (5ms)
   → Return redirect URL to user (total: 50ms) FAST

2. QR Service publishes event to Kafka (non-blocking, 2ms)
   → Event: { qr_id: "abc123", user_ip: "1.2.3.4", timestamp: "2026-02-03T10:30:00Z" }

3. Background Job picks up event (happens in parallel, user already redirected)
   → Scan Event Processor consumes from Kafka
   → Enriches with geo-location (IP → San Francisco, CA)
   → Parses user agent (Chrome 120 on iPhone 15 Pro)
   → Writes full record to Analytics DB (100ms, but user doesn't wait)

4. Metrics Aggregator processes batch every 5 minutes
   → Reads 5000 scan events from last 5 minutes
   → Calculates: Total scans today, unique visitors, top countries
   → Updates dashboard metrics in 1 batch write

5. Hot Metrics Sync (every 60 seconds)
   → Redis has: scan_count:qr_abc123 = 1247 (from 1000s of INCR commands)
   → Background job reads all counters, writes to PostgreSQL
   → Redis stays hot, PostgreSQL has persistent backup
```

**Technology Stack for Background Jobs:**
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ (same as web services for code sharing)
- **Kafka Library**: `kafkajs` (consumer groups for parallel processing)
- **Deployment**: Docker containers (separate from web services)
- **Scaling**: Horizontal - add more consumers to process faster
- **Monitoring**: Datadog tracks consumer lag, processing time, error rates

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

- **Gateway-centric:** Single entry point for observability and security
- **Cache-first:** Redis checks before database (100x performance improvement)
- **Event-driven:** Kafka decouples request processing from background jobs
- **Service isolation:** Each service can scale independently
- **Storage separation:** R2 handles static assets (QR codes, images, media)
- **Write-through caching:** High-frequency metrics stay in Redis, batch written to PostgreSQL for persistence

### Request Flow: Sequence Diagram

**The Journey of a Single Request:** This sequence diagram shows exactly how a user request flows through the system, including authentication, rate limiting, caching, database queries, and event publishing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User
    participant CDN as Cloudflare CDN
    participant Nginx
    participant Gateway
    participant Redis
    participant Core as Core Service<br/>(QR/Microsite)
    participant Postgres as PostgreSQL
    participant Kafka
    participant Events as Event Consumer<br/>(Analytics/Billing)
    participant Obs as Observability<br/>(Grafana/Sentry)

    %% Request Flow
    User->>CDN: HTTPS Request<br/>(POST /api/qr/create)
    CDN->>Nginx: Route to Origin
    Nginx->>Gateway: Forward Request
    
    %% Gateway Processing
    Gateway->>Obs: Log Request Started<br/>(timestamp, path, IP)

    Gateway->>Gateway: Validate JWT Token<br/>(verify signature & expiry)
    
    Note over Gateway: If rate limit exceeded<br/>→ Return 429 Too Many Requests
    Note over Gateway: If JWT invalid<br/>→ Return 401 Unauthorized
    
    %% Core Service Processing
    Gateway->>Core: Forward Authenticated Request<br/>(+ X-Tenant-ID header)
    
    %% Check Cache First

    Note over Events: If usage exceeds limit<br/>→ Publish billing.limit_exceeded
    Events->>Kafka: Publish Event<br/>(topic: billing.limit_exceeded)
    Kafka->>Gateway: Consume Event
    Gateway->>Redis: Cache Blocked Tenant<br/>(SET blocked:tenant_123)
```

**Key Insights from the Sequence:**

1. **Gateway as Traffic Cop (Steps 4-7)**
   - Every request goes through rate limiting (Redis check)
   - JWT validation happens at Gateway (not Core Services)
   - Failed auth/rate limit returns immediately (no wasted Core Service calls)

2. **Redis Dual Purpose (Steps 5, 10, 13)**
   - **Security**: Rate limiting counters (`rate_limit:tenant_123`)
   - **Performance**: Application data caching (`qr:abc123`)
   - **Why separate from Gateway Redis?** Same instance in Phase 1, separate clusters in Phase 3

3. **Cache-First Pattern (Steps 10-12)**
   - Core checks Redis before hitting PostgreSQL
   - Cache miss → Database query → Update cache (TTL: 1 hour)
   - Next request for same QR code is 100x faster (5ms vs 500ms)

4. **Event-Driven Decoupling (Steps 14-20)**
   - Core publishes event and returns immediately (user doesn't wait)
   - Analytics, Billing, Email services consume events independently
   - Adding new consumers (e.g., Billing) doesn't require Core Service changes

5. **Gateway-Centric Observability (Steps 4, 16, 20)**
   - Gateway logs ALL requests and responses (single source of truth)
   - Services only log specific errors or job statuses
   - Grafana dashboards aggregate Gateway logs for metrics

6. **Billing Integration (Steps 19-22)**
   - Billing Service consumes `qr.created` events
   - Increments usage counter in database
   - If limit exceeded → publishes `billing.limit_exceeded` event
   - Gateway consumes billing events and caches blocked tenants in Redis

**Why This Architecture Scales:**

- **User Experience**: Synchronous flow (steps 1-17) completes in ~50ms
- **Background Jobs**: Async processing (steps 18-22) doesn't block user response
- **Loose Coupling**: Adding Billing Service in Phase 2 requires ZERO Core Service code changes
- **Observability**: Gateway sees 100% of traffic for monitoring and debugging

---

### Architecture Decision Framework

**Problem:** How to compete with established players while managing infrastructure costs?

**Solution:** Design for scale, deploy lean

1. **Full architecture designed upfront** - All 19 services specified in technical docs
2. **Phased deployment strategy** - Deploy only core services initially
3. **Event-driven foundation** - Kafka events allow adding consumers without modifying producers
4. **Database-per-tenant design** - Enterprise isolation ready, single DB for MVP

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Why Gateway-Centric Architecture?**

The **Tenant Gateway** is the single entry point for all traffic, making it the perfect place for cross-cutting concerns:

✅ **Observability** - All traffic flows through one point, making it the single source of truth for:
- Request logging (Grafana dashboards)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- User analytics (Mixpanel events)

**Security** - Centralized enforcement of:
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting (100 req/min per tenant)
- Tenant isolation (X-Tenant-ID header injection)

**Simplicity** - Services don't need to:
- Implement their own auth logic
- Handle rate limiting
- Manage observability libraries

**Trade-off:** Single point of failure (mitigated by horizontal scaling and load balancing)

---

## Phase 1: MVP Deployment

### Scope & Infrastructure Decisions

**Objective:** Validate product-market fit with minimal infrastructure investment

**Deployed Services (4 of 19):**
1. **Auth Service** - User authentication, JWT tokens, session management
2. **QR Service** - QR code generation, Redis caching, scan tracking
3. **Analytics Service** - Real-time scan analytics, dashboard metrics
4. **Microsite Service** - Simple landing page builder (limited blocks)

**Infrastructure (Cost-Optimized):**
- **Single PostgreSQL instance** (instead of 12 tenant databases)
- **Single Redis instance** (sessions + cache)
- **Kafka single-node** (Redpanda for event-driven architecture)
- **Cloudflare CDN** (free tier for caching and DDoS protection)
- **Grafana + Prometheus** (free tier for monitoring and alerts)
- **Docker Compose** deployment (instead of Kubernetes)

**Monthly Infrastructure Cost:** ~$50-75
- VPS/Cloud Server: $30-50 (needs more resources for Kafka)
- Domain + SSL: $10
- CDN & Monitoring: $0 (free tiers)

### What's NOT Deployed (Yet)

**Deferred to Phase 2+ (Post-Revenue):**
- ML Service (AI content generation) - Requires OpenAI API costs
- Email Service - Using transactional email free tier for now
- Integrations Service - Zapier, webhooks (low priority for MVP)
- Domains Service - Custom domains (enterprise feature)
- Experiments Service - A/B testing (requires traffic first)
- Advanced Analytics - Mixpanel integration (free tier sufficient)

### MVP Feature Set

**What Users Can Do:**
- Sign up / Login (JWT authentication)
- Generate QR codes with custom colors/logos
- Create simple microsites (3-4 block types)
- Track scans (real-time analytics dashboard)
- View device, location, time data
